- Image_File_URL.pq

Event_Table.pq contains the techday event sessions details. I was unable to figure out the way to fetch the image URL for speakers.
However, I wanted to demonstrate the method to find the image URL for speakers (although I could figure out the links for all the speakers).
Hence, I have created another two files. First is the All_Speakers_with_Image_File_URL.pq which contains the list of speakers (93 in total) with their image URL.
Secondly, I have added the Image_File_URL.pq which contains all the image URL under the root directory for the images saved for the event page.

It would be a matter of coming up the method to look up each speakers in the event table and fetch the corresponding image URL from the second table.
I just did want to elaborate that step as I felt that even if that was achieved, the table for the image URL would not be complete. 

I am looking forward to watching the video that the solution to this challenge will be revealed!

Kind regards,
